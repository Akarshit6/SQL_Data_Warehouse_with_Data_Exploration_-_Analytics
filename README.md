# 🧠 SQL_Warehouse_with_Data_Exploration_&_Analysis  

### Building a Modern SQL Server–Based Data Warehouse with ETL, Data Modeling, and Advanced Data Exploration & Analytics  

---

## 📖 Project Overview  

This project integrates **Data Warehousing** and **SQL Analytics** concepts to demonstrate a full end-to-end data engineering and analysis workflow.  
It showcases how raw business data can be transformed into actionable insights using modern data architecture principles and SQL-based analytics.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Components  

### 1. **Data Warehouse Design**
- Follows **Medallion Architecture** with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.  
- Consolidates data from multiple source systems (ERP & CRM).  
- Designed for high performance and analytical efficiency.  

### 2. **ETL Pipelines**
- Extracts, transforms, and loads data from CSV files or relational databases.  
- Performs data cleansing, validation, and integration into the warehouse.  
- Ensures data consistency and accuracy across layers.  

### 3. **Data Modeling**
- Implements **Star Schema** and **Snowflake Schema** models.  
- Develops **Fact** and **Dimension** tables optimized for reporting and OLAP queries.  
- Defines clear relationships between business entities (e.g., Sales, Customers, Products).  

### 4. **Analytics & Reporting**
- Enables SQL-based analytics for KPI tracking and performance insights.  
- Supports dashboard integration using BI tools like **Power BI** or **Tableau**.  
- Facilitates time-series, trend, and segmentation analyses.

## 🔍 SQL Exploration & Analysis  

A dedicated section focuses on **comprehensive SQL scripts** for exploration, analytics, and performance monitoring:  

- **📂 Database Exploration** – Understand schema, tables, and relationships.  
- **📊 KPI & Metrics Calculation** – Compute sales growth, customer churn, and profitability.  
- **📈 Time-Based Analysis** – Perform monthly, quarterly, and yearly trend analysis.  
- **📉 Cumulative Analytics** – Use running totals, moving averages, and cumulative sums.  
- **👥 Segmentation** – Analyze customer cohorts, product categories, or regions.  

Each SQL script is modular, reusable, and demonstrates **best practices in query optimization** and data structuring.

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Build a **modern SQL Server data warehouse** for centralized analytics.  
- Integrate **data from multiple systems** (ERP, CRM) into one coherent model.  
- Ensure **data quality** through cleansing and validation.  
- Provide **clear documentation** and reproducible scripts for learning and demonstration.
